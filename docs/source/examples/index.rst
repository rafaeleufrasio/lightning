Examples
========

The following will provide examples of both basic and advanced use-cases for Lightning.

.. note::

    Most of these examples incorporate plotting functions that are specific for SED fitting.
    We do not include these in the base Lightning package. However, you may find them useful.
    Therefore, we make them publicly available in the `lightning-visualizations
    <https://github.com/kjdoore/lightning-visualization>`_ GitHub repository. They will need to
    be `added to your IDL path
    <https://www.l3harrisgeospatial.com/Support/Self-Help-Tools/Help-Articles/Help-Articles-Detail/ArtMID/10220/ArticleID/16156/Quick-tips-for-customizing-your-IDL-program-search-path>`_
    before running these examples.
